plugin_base.py — Abstract base class for all controller plugins.

Every plugin must:
  1. Live in controller/plugins/<name>.py
  2. Define a class that inherits from PluginBase
  3. Implement info() and startup()
  4. Expose a module-level name: plugin = MyPlugin

Plugin lifecycle
----------------
startup(ctrl, build_dir, config_dir)
    Called once by the runner before ctrl.run().
    Must return promptly — no loops, no blocking calls, no time.sleep().
    Allowed: ctrl.connect(), ctrl.push_pipeline(), ctrl.install_*(),
             ctrl.subscribe(event, fn, name), ctrl.emit(event, payload).

Event callbacks (e.g. on_packet_in)
    Invoked by the plugin's own thread inside ctrl.run().
    May call ctrl.install_table_entry() and other write methods safely
    (the controller serialises writes with a lock).
    May call ctrl.emit() to publish custom events to other plugins.

shutdown()
    Called after Ctrl+C, before the process exits.
    Override to release resources. Default is a no-op.

Inter-plugin communication
--------------------------
Plugins never reference each other directly.
All communication goes through the controller event bus:

    # Plugin A — publisher (inside a callback)
    ctrl.emit('mac_learned', {'device': device_name, 'mac': src_mac, 'port': port})

    # Plugin B — subscriber (inside startup)
    ctrl.subscribe('mac_learned', self.on_mac_learned, self.info()['name'])

Example skeleton
----------------
    from plugin_base import PluginBase

    class MyPlugin(PluginBase):

        def info(self):
            return {
                'name': 'my_plugin',
                'description': 'One-line description of what this plugin does.'
            }

        def startup(self, ctrl, build_dir, config_dir):
            self.logger.info("starting")
            # connect devices, install rules, subscribe to events …

        def shutdown(self):
            pass  # release resources if needed
